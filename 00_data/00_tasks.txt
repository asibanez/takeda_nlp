Oblimersen sodium is a bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide that is complementary to the first six codons of the open - reading frame of bcl-2 mRNA . It forms an aberrant heteroduplex with bcl-2 mRNA that is detected and cleaved by RNAse - H , resulting in the degradation of bcl-2 mRNA and decreased translation of the Bcl-2 protein [ 6,13 ] .

As the disease progressing , it will destroy normal bone tissue , causing pain and crowding normal hematopoiesis out ( 1)(2)(3)(4)(5 ) . The low incidence of complete remission , on the order of 5 percent , reflects the marked drug resistance of myeloma cells . Therapeutic intervention with cytokines is being evaluated in the management of a range of malignancies . Interferons have a broad spectrum of action on cellular proliferation as well as immunomodulation . In patients with myeloma , interferon alpha in combination with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to have synergistic anti - tumor effect ( 1)(2)(3)(4)(5 ) . Response rates of 20 percent were achieved when interferon alpha ( IFN - α ) was applied as single agent for multiple myeloma ( 6 ) . A synergistic activity was observed when IFN - α was combined with chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo , resulted in higher median progression - free and overall survival duration in the VAD ( Vincristin , Adriamycin , Dexamethasone ) and IFN - α combination ( 7 ) .","INTRODUCTION"

The recent return of thalidomide stems from the broad spectrum of its potential pharmacologic and immunologic effects ( 8)(9)(10 ) . The mechanism of thalidomide in treating multiple myeloma includes the possibility that thalidomide suppresses tumor necrosis factor - α production , increases the body 's production of interluekin-10 ( IL-10 ) , and inhibits angiogenesis by preventing the growth of new blood vessels to support the malignant cells ( 10,11 ) . The combination of IFN - alpha2b and thalidomide had been reported to cause synergistic decrease in mean vessel count in tumors that were resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN - alpha2b and thalidomide in vitro and have potentiated antiangiogenic activity in a xenograft model ( 12 ) . Whether the combination of IFN - α with thalidomide in patients who did not receive IFN - α or thalidomide to treat their disease before can improve the response rate , duration , and survival were interesting to us . In this study , we will evaluate and compare the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide alone or combined with IFN - α in refractory MM patients .","INTRODUCTION"
